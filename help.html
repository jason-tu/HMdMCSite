	<p> 1) Training: In order to train an MdMC, we first need
to specify the network structure, ns, or the set of previous
states upon which the current state depends (e.g., a chain
where each tile depends only on the previous horizontal tile (a
standard Markov chain), a chain where each tile depends on
the previous horizontal tile as well as the previous vertical tile,
or further complicated structures). Figure 4 shows the different
network structures that we used in our experiments. Though
more complicated structures could be devised, increasing the
complexity of the network structure exponentially increases
the number tile configurations possible, corresponding to the
number of positions in the probability table that need to be estimated
from the data. This results in a need for more training
data to properly estimate the parameters of the MdMC </p>

<p>2) Sampling: Sampling a map using a Markov random field
requires a vastly different approach than our previous sampling
algorithms, because MRFs are inherently not sequential. Our
sampler implements the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm [14].
For completeness, Algorithm 7 shows the algorithm applied
to map generation. The algorithm starts by initializing a map
with each tile chosen using the single tile distribution observed
in the training maps (P0), corresponding to a network structure
with no dependencies. Modifications are made to the map by
choosing two positions in the map randomly, and swapping
the tile types located there. The tile swap is accepted with
probability equal to min(1, e
log(Ppost )âˆ’log(Ppre )
). The swapping
procedure is repeated until each location in the map has
been chosen b times, after which the map is returned. Unlike
the previous models, our MRFs do not sample sequentially,
and, thus, do not employ a lookahead nor fallback.
